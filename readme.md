My personal repository to showcase my work done on the journey to learning programming and data science.
From newest to oldest:

- Parse gfxml: Custom script I wrote to parse proprietary XML files and extract geotechnical information (sample descriptions, carbonate content) for statistical analysis and entry in geodatabases.
- GGU Sieve to Geodin: Python script to extract particle size distributions from the text files create by GGU-Sieve.
- Blackjack: Small learning script that compares two Blackjack hands to each other and declares a winner.
